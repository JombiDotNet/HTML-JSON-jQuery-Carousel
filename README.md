A jQuery plugin to create a masked carousel from a JSON dataset

## A Simple jQuery Slideshow by Jon Raasch
Special thanks goes to [Jon Raasch](http://jonraasch.com/blog/a-simple-jquery-slideshow) for creating a Simple jQuery Slideshow.

**NOTE:** I have made changes to the sc_slideshow.css and sc_slideshow.js files for branding purposes. The original script searched for an object id of 'slideshow'. The id is now called 'sc_slideshow'. These changes are found in both the 'css/sc_slideshow.css' and 'js/sc_slideshow.js' files.

## Background
I was approached by a client to create a carousel for their website. The pictures in the carousel were to have rounded borders and have an overlapping image. 

## Approach

### Picture Editing
The pictures for the carousel would be stock photos obtained from any number of websites. Each photo could have different dimensions and orientations. The simplest solution would have been to open the pictures in Photoshop, crop them as needed, add a border with rounded corners, and export the picture as a PNG file.

  * Pictures stored as png files are very large.
